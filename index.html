This is not a story to gain pity; it is the origin story of where I found my place in sports.

        <p>In sixth grade, I was moved up to highschool varsity track. I was a sprinter, consistently competing in the 100 and 200 meter races, and thoroughly enjoyed the thrill of getting in the blocks and crossing the finish line. I loved the exhilaration that came with it - my muscles burning with exhaustion, the screams from my friends and family in the stands, the trash talk before the race had even begun. When I was a freshman in highschool and three years into my career, the coaches changed. One of the new coaches took an interest in me, paying attention to more than just my athletic abilities. I endured intense sexual harassment at the hands of my coach for the next four years. My mind was stuck in a limbo between giving up a sport I loved and simply just dealing with the treatment. When I graduated, I feared what had happened to me would happen to other young girls, and with the encouragement of those who had taken notice, I turned him in to another coach I had trusted. However, nothing happened, and he is still one of the track coaches at my well respected school.  </p>

        <p>According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, women and girls are more likely to experience violence in the realm of sports, and there are often insufficient or nonexistent safeguards against it. Remarkably, 21% of female athletes—nearly twice as many as male athletes—report having been sexually abused as children while participating in sports. </p>

        <p>One of the most widespread violations of human rights in the world is still violence against women and girls. Women and girls who participate in sports confront unique risks, heightened by inadequate or nonexistent preventative measures. However, sport has a huge potential to advance gender equality by enhancing girls' and women's well-being, confidence, and leadership abilities.  </p>


        <p>It would be believed that in a time of social media and an age of ‘posting everything,’ perpetrators of sexual harassment towards women would fear being outed. However, just in August of 2023, the then-head of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, was suspended by FIFA for kissing soccer player Jennifer Hermoso after the big win during the FIFA Women’s World Cup.</p>

        <p>According to Neil Sheffed, an editor for insidethegames.biz, the Centre for Sport and Human Rights stated that every sector of sport has a responsibility to fight harassment, sexism and abuse to ensure the maintenance of human rights throughout the entire industry. 



</p>

        <p>This is not the first or the last time a female athlete will fall victim to sexual misconduct. As stated in Global Citizen in an article written by Daniele Selby, Yasmin Brown, a taekwondo competitor, claimed for three years that she was raped and sexually abused by her coach; as a result of her suffering, her Olympic aspirations were shattered. Katherine Starr, a former Olympic swimmer, claims her coach abused her as well. 
 </p>


        <p>One of many major scandals involved Larry Nassar, the former team doctor for the United States women’s national gymnastics team. Nassar abused his position to abuse gymnasts, sexually assaulting hundreds of young athletes. This further sparked attention towards the #MeToo movement, a social movement that encouraged many to share their stories of sexual abuse in an attempt to raise awareness about sexual harassment and abuse, as well as the pervasive rape culture that exists in todays world.   </p>

        <p>When the truth was finally told about Nassar, I was still a high-level gymnast. USAG wrote a brief letter to all competitive gymnasts, apologizing for what had occurred and promising to do better. Like the claimed efforts surrounding many of today's problems, there are often promises made with nearly zero tangible commitments.  


</p>

        <p>During my time in Lausanne, Switzerland, the hub of all things global sport, I have had the privilege to attend acclaimed federations, as well as the Centre for Human Rights and the IOC museum. One of the main themes of every conversation was the importance of gender equality in sport. However, exchanges about gender equality in sport were consistently centered around equal pay and prize money, better sponsorships for female athletes, better travel methods and even the importance of same-level commentary and broadcasting for male and female competitions. </p>

         <p>The discussions failed to parallel gender equality to a woman's right to not be sexually abused or harassed during their athletic career. There was barely any talk surrounding sexual abuse being a human rights violation. It was never discussed in depth how important it is in the search for gender equality in sport, or how prevailing it is in a shocking amount of women athletes lives.  </p>


          <p>Real gender equality in sport starts with resolving abuse and misconduct towards female athletes. The link between female sport players and violence has long been on the public agenda, with widespread media coverage on countless allegations and sexual abuse transgressions. Sporting codes and conduct rules have been reformed, and yet, sexual harassment remains a prominent issue for female athletes globally. Abuse toward women is not something that stays within the borders of a nation.
 </p>

          <p> It is an uncomfortable topic, and one that is avoided until forced into the light. It is time that discussions focusing on gender equality in sport focus on a woman's right to feel safe in their athletic environment. It is time that athletes like Hermoso are not nonconsensually kissed on the lips after a once in a lifetime win. It is time that women like Makayla Moroney do not fear for their lives under the care of sports doctors like Nassar. It is time to look this ugly problem in the face. 
 </p>

          <p> When I visited FIFA, Honey Thaljieh, Corporate Communications Manager for the International Federation of Association Football, pointed up at a wall featuring portraits of all of FIFAs past male presidents. 
 </p>

 <p>“Ladies, one of you is next,” Thaljieh said.</p>

          <p> If I am ever lucky enough to work my way up the totem pole that is the global sports industry, I swear to dive into the discomfort. I promise not to avoid the ugly, but to look it in the eye, for it is time that gender equity discussions do not tip toe around the truth of what it is often like to be a woman in sport – or simply just a woman. 
 </p>

          <p> Petros Mavromichalis, Ambassador of the European Union, spoke on June 18th at the Hosts and Federations Summit, delivered by Major Events International. 
 </p>

          <p> “Womens sport stands out as a powerful instrument for societal change,” said Mavromichalis.  </p>

          <p> For any change to happen, the problem needs to be thoroughly confronted. It should not solely appear on people’s radars when something major happens and the media decides to cover it. Women's sport is a powerful instrument for societal change, but society must first acknowledge the truth of what female athletes repeatedly face in the realm of sexual harassment and abuse. </p>

          <p> There are no black and white solutions to this issue, but we must start working in the gray. Change begins when open and transparent conversations about the prevalence of sexual misconduct toward female athletes are no longer avoided. 
 </p>

 <p> As a young female athlete, I fell victim to sexual harassment at the hands of a coach I had looked up to. His efforts to hide what he was doing became more and more sloppy – and yet, none of the other coaches ever picked up on it. When I finally worked up the courage to tell my story, it was listened to and emphathized with, but never did it make a real change. There are countless other young women who have experienced this exact same situation. 

</p>

<p> Sport is a unifier, and a universal language. Let us use it as a platform to end the sexual mistreatment of female athletes around the world, and let it unite us in an effort to no longer turn a blind eye until the problem is too far in our face.
